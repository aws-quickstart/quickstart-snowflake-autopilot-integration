As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* An AWS CloudFormation template to [___].
* An Amazon API Gateway endpoint to integrate your AWS account with your Snowflake account.
* An AWS Lambda function to set up integration with your Snowflake data lake.
* An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to store assets.
* Amazon SageMaker to [___].

//TODO Dave, Please fill in the blanks.
//TODO Dave, Since the original bullets referred to resources (Lambda function, S3 bucket, CFN template), I swapped in the resource icons for them. Then I did the same for API Gateway for consistency; does the endpoint icon and label work there?
