image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/snowflake-sagemaker-autopilot-architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* An Amazon API Gateway endpoint to integrate your AWS account with your Snowflake account.
* An AWS Lambda function to set up integration with your Snowflake data lake.
* An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to store assets.
* Amazon SageMaker to apply machine learning models to your Snowflake data.

//TODO Dave, Since the original bullets referred to resources (Lambda function, S3 bucket, CFN template), I swapped in the resource icons for them. Then I did the same for API Gateway for consistency; does the endpoint icon and label work there?

// Yes, that makes sense
